# CLI Security Agent 🤖🛡️

**AI Remediator – Scanning, Detection, Blocking and Removal**

CLI Security Agent is a cross-platform security tool built with **.NET** that scans the local system to detect malicious or suspicious AI-driven processes (bots), classifies them by **security threat level**, and allows the user to **block or remove** them safely.

The project is designed with a clean architecture and is ready to evolve into a full security platform with frontend visualization and advanced analysis.
